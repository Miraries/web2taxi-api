# web2taxi Client Library

Unofficial client library for interacting with web2taxi.me for use in environments other than the official website - which, let's be honest, is terrible. Built with node.js using almost exclusively async/await and modern synthax, using [request](https://github.com/request/request) for making all http requests.

## Getting Started

### Installing

npm i web2taxi
